# HTML-Testing
Me just testing things. You guys can have it you want.

I'm uploading these here if I were to lose them. 

Buutttt, they're not good at all yet. I plan to make money soon from this. It's just I need more than an 1 hour of testing to really make something good.
That, and I have to learn CSS, or any other modern styler. If you guys have any ideas send them to me. I still have to finish my HTML lessons for code academy.
I should stop procrasinating
